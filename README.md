**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `duper` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:duper, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
##how Map.update works

takes 4 args
one is the map, list, tuple
two, the value you want to search
three - the default value of the number two when there is that value
four - takes a function that will be performed when number two is found
